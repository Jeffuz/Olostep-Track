Andrew and Jason created a simple web scraper
Andrew's web scraper is in app.js he does not use cheerio but uses puppeteer
Jason's web scraper is in scraper.js uses both puppeteer and cheerio

So Jason and Andrew decided to work on Jason's webscraper which is the scraper.js file in the server folder.
